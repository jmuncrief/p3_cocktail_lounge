# Cocktail Lounge

Cocktail Lounge is an application that retreives cocktail recipes from the [Open Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) in an easy to use graphical interface. Authenticated users can save favorite recipes for easy retrieval later.

## Concept and Usage

Cocktail Lounge was conceived of and built as a final project for the University of Arizona's Full-Stack Web Bootcamp. The interface is simple; a search bar, a dropdown, and a "random" button. Search results are dynamically written to the page with React and cleared when the next search is initiated. With the exception of the sign-up/sign-in page, Cocktail Lounge runs as a single parg application.
